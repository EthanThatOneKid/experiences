# Google STEP Internship

## Description

I worked as a STEP Intern at Google for the Summer 2021 term. I was part of the
Software Engineering Practicum (STEP) program, which is a 12-week internship for
first and second-year undergraduate students. I worked on the Hotel Center team
and developed a promotions management tool for partners to manage their hotel
promotions.
