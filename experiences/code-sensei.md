# Code Sensei at Code Ninjas

## Description

I worked as a Code Sensei at Code Ninjas in Garden Grove, California. Code
Ninjas is a kids coding center that teaches children ages 6-17 how to code
through a game-based curriculum. As a Code Sensei, I created exciting learning
resources and experiences while tutoring young code ninjas in various
programming skills such as typing, Scratch, Lua, JavaScript, and Python. I also
helped students with their projects and provided guidance on how to improve
their code. I enjoyed working with kids and helping them develop their coding
skills. I learned a lot from my experience as a Code Sensei and gained valuable
teaching and mentoring skills. I am proud of the impact I made on the students I
worked with and the positive influence I had on their coding journey. I am
grateful for the opportunity to be a part of the Code Ninjas team and help
inspire the next generation of young coders. You can learn more about Code
Ninjas and the programs they offer on their
