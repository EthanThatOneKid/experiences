# Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) at California State University, Fullerton (CSUF)

## Description

I have been a part of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) at
California State University, Fullerton (CSUF) since August 2020. ACM is a
student-led organization that provides resources and opportunities for students
to learn and grow in the field of computer science. I have been a part of the
ACM Web Development team since 2021, where I lead a group of volunteers to
maintain the ACM website. I have also founded and maintained an always-available
resources system that empowers individuals of all experience levels to acquire
open-source development skills. I have spearheaded and facilitated weekly
meetings sharing knowledge and concepts related to open-source technologies and
have guided members in creating collaborative software projects.
