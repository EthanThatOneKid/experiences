# Google SWE Internship

## Description

I worked as a Software Engineering Intern at Google for the Summer 2022 term. I
was part of the Software Engineering Internship program, where I worked on the
Google Dataplex UI team. I developed software for the team, tested and reviewed
code, and presented my project results to engineers. I designed and implemented
a reactive UI state configuration tool to streamline Dataplex Action UI testing
in Angular and RxJS environments. The tool helps engineers easily configure and
test UI states. I learned a lot from my experience at Google and gained valuable
software engineering skills. I am proud of the impact I made on the team and the
positive influence I had on the project. I am immensely humbled for the
opportunity to be a part of the Google team and help contribute to the
development of innovative software solutions.
